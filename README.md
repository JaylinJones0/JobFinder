# JobFinder

An app designed to help someone searching for a job organize their work. WIP

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

* Make sure you have installed all dependancies with npm.
* Allow your distribution files to be made with npm run build. You can end it after the first build if you do not wish to make changes.
* Make sure MongoDB is running with mongod. 
* Then you can run the application with npm start. 

### Prerequisites

The application is designed to run in a ubuntu terminal.
You need Node, ideally installed with NVM, and then you need access to npm to install all of the apps other required dependancies. 

### Deployment

To add this to a running web server, you simply need to clone it, and run the getting started steps above.

### Coding style tests

We used ESLint to enforce style. We used the base rules as our project hasn't yet necessitated special styling. Generally, our code style isn't strictly enforced just yet.
